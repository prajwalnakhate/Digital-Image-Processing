Toboggan contrast enhancement is a noniterative single-parameter linear execution time method for selectively augmenting the contrast of multispectral images of arbitrary dimensionality. Toboggan enhancement followed by contrast segmentation is compared with adaptive smoothing, all iterative, multiple parameter, parallel approach that achieves similar results. The segmentation produced by toboggan enhancement followed by contrast segmentation appears equal in quality to that of very complex optimal regional growing segmentation methods. It is concluded that toboggan enhancement is easy to understand and manipulate and is applicable to any image (multispectral, multidimensional) for which one can define a function of local discontinuity at a pixel.

The following code inputs an 4*4 image and with a gradient of 4*4 outputs a contrast inhanced image.
