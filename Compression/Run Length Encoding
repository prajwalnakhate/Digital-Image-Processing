Run-length encoding (RLE) 

A form of lossless data compression in which runs of data (sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. This is most useful on data that contains many such runs. It is not useful with files that don't have many runs as it could greatly increase the file size.

The following file RLE.m has a Matlab code for Run Length Encoding.

It has 2 features
1: To encode user input array as input.
2: To input Randomly generated binary string of length 100 as input.

The output is the Encoded string and compression ratio if compression is positive.
